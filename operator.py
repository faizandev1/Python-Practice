print("This is addition: " + str(2 + 3)) # Addition
print("This is subtraction: " + str(5 - 2)) # Subtraction
print("This is multiplication: " + str(4 * 3)) # Multiplication   
print("This is division: " + str(10 / 3)) # Division
print("This is floor division: " + str(10 // 3)) # Floor Division U can get just value not decimala that diffece if divison 




# how exponentiation and modulus work
# like if this is written 2**5 so it mean 2 multilpy by own self 5 times
# like here 2*2*2*2*2 = 32
print("This is exponentiation: " + str(2 ** 5)) # Exponentiation


# modulus is used to get the remainder of a division operation
# how it works is like if we have 10 % 3 so it will divide 10 by 3 and give us the remainder which is 1 because 3 goes into 10 three times (3*3=9) and leaves a remainder of 1.
print("This is modulus: " + str(10 % 3)) # Modulus
