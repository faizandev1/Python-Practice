# A variable is like a continer that stores data in memory.

# integer = 1
# floating_point = 1.0
# string = "Hello, World!"
# b=True //this is called bollean variable 
# d=none. //this is none type variabnle 





# how to find out the data type of any variable in pyhton 
a="hello"
b=True
c=1.5
d=5
e=complex(2,3) #this is complex number in python
print(type(a),type(b),type(c),type(d),type(e),sep="\n")




# This is imutbale means not changeable data type in python
tuples= (1,2,3,4,5) #this is tuple in python
# This is mutable means changeable data type in python
lists=[1,2,3,4,5] #this is list in python

# Mapped data:Dictonary
my_dict={"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}
print(my_dict["name"]) #this will print the value of name key in my_dict
my_dict["age"]=31 #this will change the value of age key in my_dict to 31
print(my_dict["age"]) #this will print the updated value of age key in



faizn_dict={"name":"Faizan","AGE":"23", "city":"Lahore"}
print("My name is "+faizn_dict["name"])

# You cna also update dictorary values by using the key and assigning a new value to it.
faizn_dict["AGE"]="24"
print("My age is "+faizn_dict["AGE"])



# Bolean Variables
# Bolean variables can have only two values: True or False
# They are often used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program.
# Example:
age = 18
print(age >= 18)
